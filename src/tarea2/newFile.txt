Today the zombies arrived, is the end. but we must have faith...Something came to my mind today, while we were getting attacked, if we die I know that Jesus Christ has atoned for all of our sins. So maybe tomorrow I will see my friend that are dead... Faith, and hope for the Eternal life keeps me going. Now is time to think about the scriptures John 14, John 3:3-16, Revelations 11
